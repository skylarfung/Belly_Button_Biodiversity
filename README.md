# Belly_Button_Biodiversity

## Challenge
In this project, data was collected from the navels of people across the country. Each person was assigned an id number so that the participants could remain anonymous. A dashboard was built so that the data could be quickly viewed by others. The dashboard filters through the data based on the id number selected. It includes three charts and a table that shows the demographic data of the participant. The horizontal bar chart shows the top ten bacterial types found in each person. The gauge shows how many times a week the participant washed his/her navel. Finally, the bubble chart shows all of the different bacterial strains found in the participantâ€™s navel.
